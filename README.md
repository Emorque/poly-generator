# Poly-Generator

After finding this fantastic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt3DavtVGVE), I wanted to make my own version that allows for easy customizations with the React Library.

Added some more customizations beyond, such as adding your own background, and adding your own short audio file.

The audio file gets pitched with the [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) library

## Roadmap
- [x] Allow users to upload their own short audio file, and create multiple pitches from it to play for each note.
- [x] Allow background videos for beatmaps.
- [x] Making edits more dyanmic (ex: When changing the color, the color updates in real time).
- [ ] Allow users to record their own short audio file.
- [ ] Adding unique animations.
